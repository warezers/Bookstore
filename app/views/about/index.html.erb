<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Pages Bookstore Café is the first Arabic bookstore in Istanbul. Located in the historical neighbourhood of Ayvansaray in Fatih, the bookstore caters to Arab and Syrian people of the city.
Spread over three floors, with one floor entirely dedicated to children's books, our store also acts as a library, offering books on loan.
It hosts cultural events, readings, discussions, author signings, workshops and performances, the Pages Bookstore.
As a second home for Syrians living in Turkey, our bookstore showcases Syrian culture to the rest of the world.
It is a place where everyone can meet and interact, find books and ideas of interest, and get a taste of some delectable Syrian food.
We welcome everyone to meet us here, at Pages Bookstore Café in Istanbul. We also carry books in Turkish, English and French.</p>
